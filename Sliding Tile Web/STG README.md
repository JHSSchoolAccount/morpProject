SLIDING TILE PUZZLE GAME
Sliding Tile Puzzle Game (henceforth known as STG) is a browser game exactly as the title describes. This project is meant for Towson University COSC 484 Fall '24 Semester with Prof. Jal Irani. This project is a subset of the Morp Project (COSC 484 Group 8) by Newton Nguyen, Gabe Ruppert, Nataly Quinonez et. al. This is meant to be a small browser game for entertainment purposes. All C++ code is the proprietary code of Jesse G. Harvey-Simon.

PLAYING STG
As of Ver. 2, the game lacks planned functionality. Future updates intend to rectify this simplicity.
  AVAILABLE ACTIONS: 
    Click a tile adjacent to the blank tile to swap clicked tile and blank tile.
    Click Scramble to load a new puzzle.
